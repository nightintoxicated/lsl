# lsl

lsl is a wrapper around ls to make the output a little bit more organised and easier to digest.
It really shines in large folders with lots of files and sub directories.

to install:

Option 1:
make sure you have make installed

cd /tmp

git clone the repo

cd into the cloned directory

type make install


Option 2:
download the file, chmod +x lsl, then move it to /bin or another $PATH


with regular ls
